Engineering Team Meeting - November 1, 2025

Rachel: Good morning team. Let's discuss the API performance issues reported last week.

Kevin: I investigated the slow response times. The main bottleneck is our database queries. Some are taking over 3 seconds.

Amy: That explains why users are complaining about the dashboard loading slowly. This is affecting user experience significantly.

Rachel: We need to fix this urgently. Kevin, what's your recommendation?

Kevin: We decided to implement database indexing and query optimization. This should reduce response times by 70-80%.

Amy: How long will the implementation take?

Kevin: If we start Monday, we can complete it by November 8th. I'll need support from the DevOps team for deployment.

Rachel: Agreed. This is now our top priority for the sprint. I'll coordinate with DevOps today.

Amy: Once the API is fixed, I can proceed with the new dashboard widgets. Several clients have requested this feature.

Rachel: Good. Let's also address the mobile app bugs that came up in yesterday's testing.

Kevin: We identified three critical bugs. Two are frontend issues, one is backend. We should fix all three before the next release.

Rachel: Approved. Let's make sure we don't ship with known critical bugs.

Rachel: Our sprint goal is to improve system performance and fix critical bugs. Everyone clear on their responsibilities?

Kevin: Yes, all set.

Amy: Ready to go.

Rachel: Great. Let's reconvene on Wednesday for a progress check.
